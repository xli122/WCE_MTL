# Please follow the steps below to perform model inference:
Step 1: Download the trained models for Kva-CAP and CAD-CAP from Google Drive and save them in the same directory as the .ipynb file.
Step 2: Place all the WCE images you have prepared into the data folder for model inference.
Step 3: Run inference.ipynb to perform model inference, i.e., predict the images in the data folder, and output the image names and predicted categories.

Additionally, we will upload the training process logs. The specific training code will be uploaded after the review process.
